# Kaggle Competition | Porto Seguro’s Safe Driver Prediction
From the competition [homepage](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction).

>In this competition, you’re challenged to build a model that predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year. While Porto Seguro has used machine learning for the past 20 years, they’re looking to Kaggle’s machine learning community to explore new, more powerful methods. A more accurate prediction will allow them to further tailor their prices, and hopefully make auto insurance coverage more accessible to more drivers.

### Data Description

>In the train and test data, features that belong to similar groupings are tagged as such in the feature names (e.g., *ind*, *reg*, *car*, *calc*). In addition, feature names include the postfix *bin* to indicate binary features and *cat* to indicate categorical features. Features without these designations are either continuous or ordinal. Values of **-1** indicate that the feature was missing from the observation. The *target* columns signifies whether or not a claim was filed for that policy holder.
